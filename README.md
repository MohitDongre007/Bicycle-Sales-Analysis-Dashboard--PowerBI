# Bicycle-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard--PowerBI
This is a Sales Dashboard of a Bicycle Store where I have applied the skills that I have learned so far. It is created using Power Bi software. I have performed ETL processes on this that is Extract, Load, Transform. Along with this I have established relationships between the various tables commomly called as Modelling the data. Here I have managed to get good insights and are easy to understand for other users as the Visualizations are a better and easier to convey the insights rather than coding.

Hope you like this Dashboard, I'll upload more dashboards in comming time. Thankyou.

Datasets are provided for practice purpose. Go through the dashboard and see how measures are created, how calculated columns are created, how to model data, etc
